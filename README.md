In this project, I have:

- Created a class called Animal, which contains at least 2 methods and 3 variables.
- Created 4 more classes, each with their own methods and variables, which also inherit from Animal.
- Created 2 interfaces, each containing one method, which could be implemented across my hierarchy.
